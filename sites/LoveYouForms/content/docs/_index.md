## Docs Under Construction!!!

As of Today this documentation is in progress - more coming soon.

## Motivation

To make it fast and simple to handle form submissions for **unlimited web forms** of **unlimited static websites** without relying on a paid service, or managing processes around constrictive free usage tiers.

## What is LoveYouForms?

It is a Node.js application which is served as cloud functions on the Firebase platform. It uses the scalable NoSQL cloud Firestore database of the Firebase platform.

## Why Use LoveYouForms?

Designed to:
* make setup and usage quick as possible
* leverage a stable and fully-managed backend/system platform

The app runs on Google's Firebase platform. So the servers, Node.js environment, database, and scaling are automated and managed by them.

## When to Use LoveYouForms?

Use it for websites which primary motivation is to capture form submissions from anonymous (not authenticated) visitors. Such as for capturing data from lead-generation webforms.
